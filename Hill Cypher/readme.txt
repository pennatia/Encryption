Module Info:
Module 11 - Hill Cypher (Due 08/15/2021 11:59 PM)

Approach: 
The code uses the concepts linear algebra concepts and numpy ndarrays to encrypt a message to an array of
numbers, and subsequently decrypt. The code defines a Class HillCypher, which includes a number of different
appropriate functions necessary for the encryption and decryption of a coded message using a HillCypher. These include
the calculation of a determinant, the determination of a matrix's invertibility, 
the calculation of a modular multiplicative inverse, and two subsequent 'catch all'
functions for encryption and decryption, dependent on the above. 

The code is also designed to raise a number of specific exceptions, as per the requirements of the assignment. 

Known Bugs: 
Current dictionary only supports capital letters. (Easy fix)
