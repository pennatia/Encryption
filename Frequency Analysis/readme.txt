Module 7 - Frequency Analysis (Due 07/18/2021 11:59 PM)

Approach: 

The code is designed to take in two text files as input: an encrypted message and a frequency list. First,
the program defines a function get_freq_counts which splits the inputted string message into its constituent
characters. The function places these characters in a list, counts the occurrence of each, and maps the 
calculated frequency to a key value in a dictionary. 

The rest of the code then proceeds to prepare the inputted files for analysis (creating a frequency dictionary
based on the input file), and subsequently creates a dictionary mapping characters-to-characters based on 
an equal-value condition. We then use the final dictionary (translator) to replace each character in the 
original message, and print the decrypted statement.
